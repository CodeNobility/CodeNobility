# **👋 Hey there, I'm Prince Gupta!**  

## 🚀 **About Me**  
I’m an aspiring **AI & Machine Learning Engineer**, passionate about **building intelligent systems** and uncovering insights from data. I love working with **machine learning models** and performing **data analysis** using tools like:  

🔹 **Languages, Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, SQL, Excel, Jupyter, Tableau, PyCharm, vscode     
🔹 **ML Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras.     
🔹 **Current Focus:** Deep Learning & Neural Networks  

When I’m not coding, you'll probably find me **playing cricket**, exploring the world of data both on and off the field. 🏏🔥  

## 🌱 **Currently Learning**  
🔸 **Deep Learning** – Exploring ANN, CNN, RNN & Transformers  
🔸 **Mastering Data Analysis** – Advanced techniques & visualization
